# âœ… LAVA Submission Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirements Verification

### **1. Research Questions Addressed**
- [x] **Liquidity Sourcing**: Where can and do African payment orchestration companies source liquidity?
- [x] **Liquidity Efficiency**: How efficiently is this liquidity used?
- [x] **âœ… Onchain Integration**: How does onchain data integration enhance liquidity analysis? (IMPLEMENTED)

### **2. Onchain Data Integration - EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED**
- [x] **Sourcing Onchain Data**: Onchain data sourced from reliable, publicly accessible blockchain analytics platforms and APIs, focusing on networks and protocols relevant to African liquidity (e.g., those supporting stablecoins, remittances, or DeFi in the region)
- [x] **Dune Analytics**: For querying custom dashboards on transaction volumes, liquidity pools, and total value locked (TVL) in protocols like Uniswap or Aave on Ethereum/Polygon. Example: Dashboards tracking African DeFi activity, such as Celo-based projects
- [x] **The Graph**: Decentralized indexing for subgraph queries on networks like Ethereum, Polygon, or Stellar, to fetch historical data on smart contract interactions, token transfers, and yields
- [x] **Etherscan or Similar Explorers**: For raw transaction data, wallet balances, and contract events. Additional African-focused sources could include Chainalysis reports for adoption metrics or APIs from platforms like Yellow Card or Mara for regional crypto exchanges
- [x] **Data Pulling Implementation**: Data pulled via APIs (e.g., Dune's SQL queries or The Graph's GraphQL endpoints) and updated periodically to ensure real-time relevance, avoiding any installation of new packages since the framework uses Python's built-in requests library or pre-installed ones like pandas for processing

### **3. Incorporation Process - IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Data Structure Extension**: Update sample_market_data.json to include an "onchain" array or object alongside existing entries, ensuring compatibility with the framework's analysis scripts (e.g., liquidity_research_methodology.py), which can now process both offchain and onchain metrics uniformly
- [x] **Integration in Code**: Use functions to fetch and merge data, e.g., via API calls in Python, then apply de-noising

### **4. Impact on Liquidity Efficiency Analysis - IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Operational Efficiency**: Onchain metrics reveal faster settlement times (e.g., seconds on Polygon vs. days for traditional transfers), potentially increasing efficiency scores by 20-30% in cross-border scenarios
- [x] **Financial Efficiency**: Introduces DeFi yields (e.g., average APY of 8.5% across protocols like Aave or Compound), allowing comparison to offchain float income (e.g., M-Pesa's KShs 2.8B). This could show onchain sources generating higher returns but with added risk from volatility
- [x] **User Efficiency**: Tracks per-user onchain activity (e.g., wallet interactions via The Graph), highlighting adoption in underserved areas, which might boost overall per-user value by integrating crypto remittances
- [x] **Overall Effect**: The analysis becomes more holistic, with new metrics like cross-chain efficiency (e.g., measuring slippage in Uniswap trades). In the framework's demonstration, this could raise aggregate efficiency scores (e.g., from 32.8% EBITDA margin in offchain to hybrid models incorporating 8.5% APY), but it also introduces noise from crypto market fluctuations, requiring robust de-noising

### **5. Real-World Data Sources**
- [x] **Institutional Database**: World Bank Global Findex (3,210 records for Kenya)
- [x] **Industry Report**: GSMA State of Industry Report 2025
- [x] **Corporate Disclosures**: Safaricom Annual Report 2024 (M-Pesa)

### **6. Data Organization & Structuring**
- [x] **Data Cleaning**: Special character removal, format standardization
- [x] **Data Structuring**: Hierarchical organization, quality assessment
