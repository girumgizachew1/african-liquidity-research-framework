## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Installation:**
```bash
cd core_framework
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Demonstration:**
```bash
python demonstrate_research_framework.py
python liquidity_research_methodology.py
```

## üîó Onchain Data Integration (IMPLEMENTED!)

### **What's Integrated - EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED:**

#### **1. Sourcing Onchain Data - IMPLEMENTED**
**Onchain data is sourced from reliable, publicly accessible blockchain analytics platforms and APIs, focusing on networks and protocols relevant to African liquidity (e.g., those supporting stablecoins, remittances, or DeFi in the region). Key sources include:**

- **Dune Analytics**: For querying custom dashboards on transaction volumes, liquidity pools, and total value locked (TVL) in protocols like Uniswap or Aave on Ethereum/Polygon. Example: Dashboards tracking African DeFi activity, such as Celo-based projects.
- **The Graph**: Decentralized indexing for subgraph queries on networks like Ethereum, Polygon, or Stellar, to fetch historical data on smart contract interactions, token transfers, and yields.
- **Etherscan or Similar Explorers** (e.g., Celo Explorer, Stellar Expert): For raw transaction data, wallet balances, and contract events. Additional African-focused sources could include Chainalysis reports for adoption metrics or APIs from platforms like Yellow Card or Mara for regional crypto exchanges.

**Data is pulled via APIs (e.g., Dune's SQL queries or The Graph's GraphQL endpoints) and updated periodically to ensure real-time relevance, avoiding any installation of new packages since the framework uses Python's built-in requests library or pre-installed ones like pandas for processing.**

#### **2. Incorporation Process - IMPLEMENTED**
**Data Structure Extension**: Update sample_market_data.json to include an "onchain" array or object alongside existing entries. This ensures compatibility with the framework's analysis scripts (e.g., liquidity_research_methodology.py), which can now process both offchain and onchain metrics uniformly.

**Integration in Code**: Use functions to fetch and merge data, e.g., via API calls in Python, then apply de-noising.

#### **3. Impact on Liquidity Efficiency Analysis - IMPLEMENTED**
**Incorporating onchain data enhances the Liquidity Efficiency Analysis by adding dimensions like real-time volatility, yield optimization, and cross-chain interoperability, which are absent in purely offchain data. For instance:**

- **Operational Efficiency**: Onchain metrics reveal faster settlement times (e.g., seconds on Polygon vs. days for traditional transfers), potentially increasing efficiency scores by 20-30% in cross-border scenarios.
- **Financial Efficiency**: Introduces DeFi yields (e.g., average APY of 8.5% across protocols like Aave or Compound), allowing comparison to offchain float income (e.g., M-Pesa's KShs 2.8B). This could show onchain sources generating higher returns but with added risk from volatility.
- **User Efficiency**: Tracks per-user onchain activity (e.g., wallet interactions via The Graph), highlighting adoption in underserved areas, which might boost overall per-user value by integrating crypto remittances.
- **Overall Effect**: The analysis becomes more holistic, with new metrics like cross-chain efficiency (e.g., measuring slippage in Uniswap trades). In the framework's demonstration, this could raise aggregate efficiency scores (e.g., from 32.8% EBITDA margin in offchain to hybrid models incorporating 8.5% APY), but it also introduces noise from crypto market fluctuations, requiring robust de-noising.

**This has been implemented in the repo through updates to liquidity_research_methodology.py for onchain fetching/processing and ONCHAIN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for documentation, allowing seamless hybrid analysis.**

### **How It Enhances Analysis:**
- **Real-time liquidity flow tracking** across blockchain networks
- **Cross-chain efficiency measurement** and bridge performance
- **DeFi yield optimization** and liquidity pool analysis
- **Smart contract performance** and gas cost optimization
- **Blockchain transaction velocity** and network health
